  title: Adaptive Vue.js Apps with The Composition API
  extract: >
    The Vue.js composition API brings us a lot of new ways to share functionality across components. I will be introducing
    how to use `vue-use-web` to tackle "adaptive" Apps that behave differently depending on various aspects of the user
    device, like their memory, battery level, and connection speed. This allows us to be more empathetic towards our
    users and that we can give them a better experience.

  title: Explaining the VuePress Magic 🧙
  extract: >
    VuePress is awesome and full of magic, I could say for multiple reasons:  as technology and as a product!
    But how is this magic happening that make VuePress sites so fast? How is VuePress doing all that awesome stuff for
    you and being very consumer-friendly? I will answer all these questions in my presentation, but before doing that I
    will take a step back and I will explain what are static site generators, why is their popularity keeps rising, how
    are they working under the hood and how is the Vue ecosystem looking.
    I will present a deep dive into how these tools work, I will show you what happens behind the scenes and what
    technologies they are using by using code samples from VuePress codebase. For example, I will explain how a markdown
    file is processed. But also I will present some interesting features that set VuePress apart in the ecosystem because
    if set up correctly VuePress can be very powerful.
    Magic is awesome but magic is even better when is explained :)

  title: Rapid development with Vue.js and Tailwind
  extract: >
    Would like to provide insights into how the combination of Vue.js and tailwindcss can make development very fast,
    yet stable and how you can grow prototypes into real production ready features with these 2 libraries. In the talk
    I would point out the benefits of tailwind and how it personally helped me and my team to have a unified css approach
    on several projects. At the end I will prepare a live coding demo and build a fully accessible small component to
    showcase why the combination of Tailwind and Vue increases developer productivity and let's you focus more on the
    core features of your application rather than finding third parties and having a hard time customizing them.

  title: SEO in a Vue.js world
  extract: >
    What do a SaaS landing page, blog and e-commerce store have in common? They should all be found through a search
    engine, ideally by as many people as possible. Search engine optimization (SEO) can therefore be decisive for the
    success and also the revenue of your projects.
    But when it comes to Vue.js and SEO, there are many controversial opinions about the impact of Vue on SEO efforts.
    In my session we will go through the basics of SEO and examine best practices and their implementations with the
    help of vue-meta and Nuxt.js.

    techniques to customize data visualizations in Vue, for a global audience. How to format strings, numbers, dates,
    times, currencies, calendars, x/y axis, and more! We'll talk about the unique challenges with right to left and
    bi-directional locale visualizations, how colors, iconography, and emojis can be perceived differently in distinct
    cultures, as well as mapping and cartography for a global audience.
