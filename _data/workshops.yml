    intro: |
      Companies aim to create robust and quality products that satisfy their users needs, and as a developer you have
      the power to help achieving that goal.
      Testing takes a great part on this: it doesn't only make sure the code you're creating works, but also helps
      making sure the user requirements are met and to create a sustainable architecture, helping with refactoring,
      and much more.
      This workshop will lead you to learn all you need to know to test your Vue.js applications step by step and in
      the most practical way possible, where you will create tests yourself.
      By the end of it, you will be able to test a Vue.js application following best practices.
